        For Dex, Jordan, and Becks, the garage was the only place where the world finally made sense. 
        Bound together by a shared history of being the "square pegs" in their previous high-end racing circles — Dex for his 
        unconventional engineering, Jordan for an aggressive driving style that scared off sponsors, and Becks for her refusal 
        to play the corporate game — they decided to stop trying to fit in and start standing out. 
        They formed The Misfits not just as a team, but as a statement: that brilliance often thrives in the fringes. 
      </br>

        Signing up for Next Orbit Speedfest was the ultimate gamble to prove that a patchwork crew with a chip on their 
        shoulder could outpace the polished giants of the circuit, turning their collective outsider status into their greatest competitive edge.
