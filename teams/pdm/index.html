            Hi I'm Penny, I'm from the UK and driving for PDM Racing. 
            I love racing, driving fast cars and like just having fun doing anything around the city. 
            I'm really excited for this years S95 championship and feel privileged to be apart of it.

          </br>
            I grew up in the garage, hands dirty, engines apart, learning every bolt and build from the ground up. 
            Cars aren't just a hobby to me, they're in my blood. I live for the stance culture, the precision of a perfect setup, and the raw energy of the drift scene. 
            From late night builds to tire smoke on the track, I'm here for one thing - The thrill of the race.
          </br>
            Built, not bought. Driven by passion.

            Hi, I'm Robbie Valentino from a small island called Malta connoisseur of cheese and birria tacos, 
            sworn enemy of ketchup, and a full-time menace behind the wheel of anything expensive. I've got a hot girlfriend, 
            great friends, and absolutely zero intention of slowing down… ever.
